## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines ðŸ˜Ž

To make git commit messages **easier to read** and faster to reason about, we follow some guidelines on most commits to keep the **format predictable**.

**Examples**:

```
docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
docs: add API documentation to the bot
test(server): add cache tests to the movie resource
fix(web): add validation to the phone input field
fix(web): remove avatar image from being required in the form
fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js
```

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
